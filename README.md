Web app to easily find bird song recordings.
Deployed at https://birdsong-app-29564.herokuapp.com/

Enter the bird species in English to directly search for sound recordings or first translate it from any language.
Note: Google Translate does not yet handle the species names very well, so check the translation before searching.

This app uses the Xeno-Canto API to fetch bird song recordings by query and the Google Cloud Translation API for translation into English from the detected language.
